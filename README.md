# Detection Lab

## Objective

The primary purpose of this project is to simulate an attack scenario in a controlled environment to generate telemetry and analyze logs for potential detection methods. This involves creating basic malware, setting up a reverse shell listener, executing the malware on a target Windows virtual machine, and then reviewing telemetry in Splunk with Sysmon data to gain insights into detection opportunities.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Splunk Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
